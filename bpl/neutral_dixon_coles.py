class NeutralDixonColesMatchPredictor:
    """
    A Dixon-Coles like model for predicting match outcomes, modified to:
    - Estimate correlation between defence and attack abilities
        - strong defenders tend to also be strong attackers
    - Add a separate home advantage for each team
      (not just a single global parameter)
    - Add option to include team covariates to build informative
      attack/defence priors
        - should improve initial predictions for new teams (e.g., due to
          promotion) which mostly rely on priors
    - Work for matches in neutral venues (e.g. international tournaments)
    - Add separate home & away, defence & attack, advantages/disadvantages
      for each team
    - Add option to exponentially downweigh games with time
      (i.e., recent games get more weight)
    - Add possibility to weight games according to match importance

    Note that this is a special case of NeutralDixonColesMatchPredictorWC
    model where confederation (or league) strength is not modelled
    (all teams are assumed to be in the same confederation or league).
